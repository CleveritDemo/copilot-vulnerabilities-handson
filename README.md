## ‚ö†Ô∏è Detecting and Mitigating Security Vulnerabilities with GitHub Copilot üîç

This hands-on activity aims to demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can assist in identifying potential security vulnerabilities in your code. Copilot not only helps in detecting these threats but also provides explanations of the vulnerabilities and suggests ways to fix them.

### üíªActivity 1:

1. **SQL Injection**: Malicious SQL code execution through user inputs.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.
4. **Broken Authentication**: Compromised authentication mechanisms.
5. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Inadequate protection of sensitive information.

### Step 1: Tell to GitHub Copilot to help you to review the security of your files.

üë§Prompt:

```
I need your assistance in reviewing the security of some files. Please help identify any potential vulnerabilities, especially those related to:

SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Broken Authentication
Sensitive Data Exposure
If you find any other security issues, please flag them as well. For each vulnerability, provide a brief explanation of why it's a threat and how it can be exploited. Also, suggest best practices or code improvements to mitigate these vulnerabilities effectively. Please let me now if you understand my requirement and then I'm going to specify you the file to scan.
```

üë§ Prompt:

```
let start with the #file:example1.ts
```

We are going to tell Copilot for the rest of the files (from example 1 to example 5)

```
Let's review the provided code for potential vulnerabilities:

1. SQL Injection
Threat: SQL Injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate a SQL query by injecting malicious input. This can lead to unauthorized data access or modification.

Exploitation: An attacker can input a string like example@example.com' OR '1'='1 which would make the query return all users.

Mitigation: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection.

2. Sensitive Data Exposure
Threat: Hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials in the source code can lead to data exposure if the code is leaked.

Exploitation: If someone gains access to the source code, they can use the credentials to access the database.

Mitigation: Use environment variables to store sensitive information.

3. Broken Authentication
Threat: The code does not handle authentication or authorization, which could allow unauthorized access to user data.

Exploitation: Anyone who can call this function can access user data without any checks.

Mitigation: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks.

Suggested Code Improvements
Step-by-Step Plan
Use environment variables for sensitive data.
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Add authentication and authorization checks.

### üíªActivity 2:

**STRIDE**

A threat modeling framework used to identify and categorize potential security threats in software systems. It was developed by Microsoft and is widely used in the field of cybersecurity to help developers and security professionals systematically analyze the security risks associated with a system. The acronym STRIDE stands for:

1. **Spoofing**: The threat of an attacker impersonating another user or system to gain unauthorized access.
2. **Tampering**: The threat of unauthorized modification or corruption of data, code, or configuration settings.
3. **Repudiation**: The threat that a user or attacker could deny having performed an action without other parties being able to prove otherwise, often due to a lack of proper logging or auditing.
4. **Information Disclosure**: The threat of exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties, leading to privacy breaches or data leaks.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The threat of an attack that disrupts the normal functioning of a system, making it unavailable to its intended users.
6. **Elevation of Privilege**: The threat that an attacker could gain elevated access rights or privileges within a system, potentially allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized to do.

### Step 1: Tell to Copilot about STRIDE and how it applies to identifying security threats

üë§ Prompt:

```
Do you have knowledge of the STRIDE threat modeling framework? If so, please provide a brief explanation of STRIDE and how it applies to identifying security threats in software. In the following prompt, I will specify which file you will analyze based on STRIDE to help identify potential security threats.
```

ü§ñ Copilot Chat Answer:

```
Yes, I have knowledge of the STRIDE threat modeling framework. Here's a brief explanation:

STRIDE Framework
STRIDE is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft to help identify security threats in software systems. It stands for:

Spoofing: Impersonating something or someone else.

Threat: Unauthorized access by pretending to be a legitimate user.
Mitigation: Strong authentication mechanisms.
Tampering: Modifying data or code.

Threat: Unauthorized changes to data or code.
Mitigation: Integrity checks, digital signatures.
Repudiation: Denying an action without a way to prove otherwise.

Threat: Users denying they performed an action.
Mitigation: Logging and auditing.
Information Disclosure: Exposing information to unauthorized users.

Threat: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Mitigation: Encryption, access controls.
Denial of Service (DoS): Making a system unavailable.

Threat: Overloading the system to make it unavailable.
Mitigation: Rate limiting, resource management.
Elevation of Privilege: Gaining higher privileges than allowed.

Threat: Unauthorized access to higher-level functions.
Mitigation: Proper access controls, least privilege principle.
Applying STRIDE to Identify Security Threats
When analyzing a file or system, you can use the STRIDE framework to systematically identify potential security threats:

Spoofing: Check for authentication mechanisms and ensure they are robust.
Tampering: Look for data integrity checks and protections against unauthorized modifications.
Repudiation: Ensure actions are logged and can be audited.
Information Disclosure: Verify that sensitive data is protected and not exposed.
Denial of Service: Identify potential points of overload and ensure protections are in place.
Elevation of Privilege: Check access controls and ensure users cannot gain unauthorized privileges.
Please specify the file you would like me to analyze using the STRIDE framework.
```

üë§Prompt:

```
the file to analize using STRIDE framework is: #file:example6.ts
```
